In today’s situation farmers are facing a part of issues and are facing a few challenges like poor infrastructure, need of information on developing dvances, poor soil quality, investment within the cultivate generation etc. when developing tomato crops. In India, numerous agriculturists need the information to legitimately select fertilizers and pesticides for their crops. Due to the diseases that affect the crop, farmers as well as the buyers face a critical loss. About 60% of the farmers confront losses in crop yield. As a result there have been numerous reports of deaths of the farmers. Later progressions in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Techniques have led to the improvement of automated systems for distinguishing and recognizing infections in images. This model can extract the features of the disease that’s show within the given image. In our literature survey We recognized the tomato crop diseases and focused on certain aspects which include image dataset, no. of diseases (classes), precision of the model etc. We created a model using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images and explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) by using a local interpretability technique called as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to explain the predictions that are made by the model. Evaluation of the images from the tomato Disease Image dataset shows that our model’s accuracy is 97.78.
